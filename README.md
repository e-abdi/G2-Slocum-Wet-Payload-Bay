# G2 Slocum Glider Wet Payload Bay
This is a quick write-up for a wet paylaod bay I designed to fit on G2 Slocum gliders. 
Slocums lack a wet payload bay for larger sensors and traditionally, these have been simply strapped on top of the glider. But recently, Teledyne has designed a wet payload bay which can be used with G3s to fit large sensors such as an EK80 echosoundsr. This however is not compatible with G2 gliders.
I went through a few iterations of designs until the 3D prints were a good match to G2.

The interface disk has some quite tricky contours. In theory you could use a mill and lathe to machine this but I had access to a HAAS CNC at the [Munich Makerspace](https://www.unternehmertum.de/en/services/makerspace) so I decided to give that a go.

I started with a 200x25mm aluminium disk as my stock.

I was quite pleased with the results. Then removed the rest of the back side on a lathe.

Then I machined a second disk for front and placed some rods in between. Here is the final result.

I'm uploading the STEP file here. Let me know if you need any other format for example the Fusion format with all the toolpath for CNC.
