# G2 Slocum Glider Wet Payload Bay
This is a quick write-up for a wet paylaod bay I designed to fit on G2 Slocum gliders. 
Slocums lack a wet payload bay for larger sensors and traditionally, these have been simply strapped on top of the glider. But recently, Teledyne has designed a wet payload bay which can be used with G3s to fit large sensors such as an EK80 echosoundsr. This however is not compatible with G2 gliders.
